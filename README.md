# PA1: StackOverflow Developer Survey

## Background

StackOverflow is a popular question and answer website for developers. Every year, they conduct a survey of developers to understand the tools they use, the technologies they work with, and the challenges they face. The survey data is publicly available and can be downloaded from the StackOverflow website. It is the most comprehensive survey of software developers and programmer, and provides a wealth of information about the developer community. 

The survey goes back to 2011 and is conducted annually. You can access the survey results at [this link](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/). 

## Instructions 

For the following questions, you will be using the 2024 StackOverflow Developer Survey. 

First you would have to fork the repository to your GitHub account. Then clone the repository to your local machine.

There are 25 questions in total. To answer the questions, directly edit this file by adding text after the questions. To pick an option in the checkboxes, put an `x` between the brackets. For example, `[x]`. 

When you have answered all the questions, add->commit->push the changes to your forked GitHub repository and create a Pull Request. 

## Questions

1. Which of the following courses have you taken/are taking at Furman? 

- [ ] CSC-272: Data Mining
- [X] CSC-341: Database Systems
- [ ] CSC-342: Web Development
- [ ] CSC-332: Data Communications and Networking
- [ ] CSC-348: Game Design and Development

2. Do you intend to pursue a career in software development?

- [X] Yes
- [ ] No

3. Are you more interested in front-end or back-end development? Front-end development involves working on the user interface and user experience of a website or application. Back-end development involves working on the server-side of a website or application, including databases and server-side programming focused on algorithms, data processing, and business logic.

- [ ] Front-end development
- [X] Back-end development

4. What kind of computer programming are you most interested in?

- [ ] Web development
- [ ] Mobile development
- [ ] Game development
- [X] Data science
- [ ] Machine learning
- [ ] Embedded systems 

5. Before you read the survey results, come up with top five questions you would like answered about the software industry and life of a software developer? 
a. What skills are the most valuable to learn as a computer scientist?
b. If you could go back to college, what opportunities would you take that you had not taken prior?
c. What real-life applications have you found yourself using your skills for?
d. Have you found the software industry to be easier or harder on average than some other fields?
e. In terms of a job in the field, do you prefer the idea of freelancing or working for a company?

6. The first thing you should do when reading a survey is to understand the methodology, particularly the sample size and how any biases in the sample may affect the results. What is the sample size (number of respondents) of the survey? 
65,437 people were surveyed.

7. Do you spot any potential biases in the survey that might not make the results truly representative of the developer community?
Response bias - People who decided to stop their career in the field will not answer as often as people still in the field.

8. What are the most popular programming languages in 2024, amongst all respondents? How do the results of professional developers compare with respondents learning to code?
Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python, and SQL are the four most popular languages. Professional developers prefer Javascript, SQL, and HTML/CSS over Python, but those who are still learning to code prefer Python over the others.

9. Are you surprised by the results of the previous question? Why or why not? Speculate on why the results are the way they are.
Not very surprising. Javascript is more complicated and has more real-life applications, but Python is much easier to use to learn how to code. This would make Python more popular with newer developers, and would make Javascript more popular among seasoned developers.

10. How many of the 10 most popular programming languages in 2024 are you familiar with / proficient in?
I have some experience with HTML/CSS and Java from high school classes, I'm learning SQL in 341, and I've used Python for the past couple years in Furman classes.

11. Have you worked with databases, and if so, which database systems have you used? Where do these databases rank in the survey results for the most popular databases in 2024?
I'm beginning to work with databases in CSC 341, and we're currently using MySQL, which ranks at 2nd place with 40.3% of respondants using it.

12. What is the most popular IDE in 2024, amongst all respondents? Which ones do you use from the top 10?
The most popular IDE is VSCode, which is the only one I use among the top 10.

13. CSC-272: Data Mining last semester covered Pandas and Scikit-learn. CSC-372: Machine Learning this semester covers PyTorch and Numpy. What percentage of respondents use these frameworks / libraries in 2024?
20.7% use Pandas, 10.6% use Scikit-Learn, 10.6% use PyTorch, and 21.2% use Numpy.

14. What technologies do you want to learn in the future? How do your choices compare with "Worked with vs. want to work" with section of the suvey? 
Using Numpy and Pandas in Python is very useful, and Javascript will be vital to a career in the software field.

15. Do you have a preference for working in-person or remotely or a mix of both? 

- [ ] In-person
- [ ] Remote
- [X] Hybrid

15. How do your preferences compare with the survey results?
42% of the respondants also prefer hybrid.

16. Do you currently use AI tools in your development process?

- [X] No, and I don't plan to

17. How do your choices compare with the survey results?
Only 24.4% of respondants agree with me.

18. How favorable is your stance on using AI tools as part of your development workflow?

- [X] Indifferent
- [ ] Unsure 
- [ ] Unfavorable
- [ ] Very unfavorable

19. How do your choices compare with the survey results?
18.7% of respondants agree with me.

22. Do you code outside of course work? How do your choices compare with the survey results?

23. What percentage of respondents are satisfied in their current professional developer role?
20.2% are happy.

24. What is the median salary of developers who work with Bash/Shell (pwd, ls, mkdir, cd..)? 
$75,184

25. Write your general impressions of the survey results. What did you find most interesting? What did you find most surprising? What did you find most concerning?
They seem to suggest that a lot of people both like/are okay with a career in the field and are paid well. I found the number of different languages interesting, the median pay of the more rare languages surprising, and the relatively low pay of the more common languages concerning.
